### Configuration Summary
OK, so I'm going to take this step by step, highlighting both the way I got everything to work, in addition to any errors or issues I got stuck on. There were quite a few.

Also, first off, I want to point out the following were excellent resource lists, which I used extensively to find documentation and search for solutions to common problems I had throughout the project:

[Allan's Markedly underwhelming and potentially wrong resource list for P5](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/markedly-underwhelming-and-potentially-wrong-resource-list-for-p5/8587)  
Allan's list was a great resource for getting through the basic setup steps.  
[Kirk Brunson's Project 5 Resources](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/project-5-resources/28343)  
I think I used most of Kirk's links throughout the project. Most of my sources are from his list.  
[Aaron_M's P5 How I got through it](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/p5-how-i-got-through-it/15342)  
A lot of great links to the Digital Ocean Community tutorials.  
[Norbert Stuken's FSND-P5_Linux-Server-Configuration](https://github.com/stueken/FSND-P5_Linux-Server-Configuration)  
Norbert does mention that this is basically a walkthrough, and it is very easy to go through his steps piece by piece to do the project. However, what I found most helpful was organizing the thinking for how to approach the project, and reading each of the sources listed to understand what's happening when you're making each call/modifying files
